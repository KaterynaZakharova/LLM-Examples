Existing right IJ temporary triple-lumen catheter was seen\\nwith the tip in the axillary vein. This was successfully\\nrepositioned/replaced with the new catheter tip positioned in\\nthe distal SVC.\\n2. Angiography demonstrated dilated tortuous left bronchial\\nartery, supplying the left lung and specifically, the left lower\\nlobe. Some filling of an adjacent pulmonary artery was seen at\\nthe end of the angiography suggesting microvascular shunting.\\n3. No contributor was identified from the left bronchial artery\\nanywhere in its course to an anterior spinal artery.\\n4. During selective microcatheterization of the left bronchial\\nartery, a\\nsmall amount of contrast extravasation was noted in the\\nmediastinum from the proximal portion of the artery. Subsequent\\naortic angiography demonstrated no contrast extravasation from\\nthe aorta or evidence of aortic dissection.\\n5. Following this, 5 French [**Last Name (un) 3056**] was again used to select\\nthe ostium of the left bronchial artery. From this location,\\nparticle embolization with 300-500 micron Embospheres was\\nperformed to good slowing of flow and\\nangiographic result.\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. Successful particle embolization in the left bronchial\\nartery, as\\ndescribed above.\\n2. Successful replacement and repositioning of non-tunneled\\nright internal\\njugular vein triple lumen catheter, with the tip now in distal\\nSVC. The line is ready to use.\\n.\\n[**4-26**] CT CHEST\\nFINDINGS:\\nAIRWAYS AND LUNGS: Since [**2198-4-22**], high-density\\nconsolidation in the\\nleft lower lobe sparing only a portion of the superior segment\\nhas increased and new in posterior basal segment of the right\\nlower lobe. Preexisting left lower lobe cavity is obscured by\\nthis large consolidation. In addition,\\ndiffuse ground-glass opacities without septal thickening in both\\nlungs (left side more than right), are also new since [**Month (only) 547**]\\n[**2197**]. Keeping with clinical history, these are highly suggestive\\nof multifocal pulmonary hemorrhage, most pronounced in the left\\nlower lobe. Thin rim of hyperdensity along the\\nposterior pleural space in the left lower lobe is probably due\\nto the\\ndissection of the blood from the consolidation.\\nMEDIASTINUM: Thyroid gland is normal. Endotracheal tube tip lies\\n3 cm above the carina. There are no pathologically enlarged,\\nmediastinal,\\nsupraclavicular or axillary lymph nodes. Heart is normal size,\\nand thin rim of pericardial fluid is likely reactive. Coronary\\nartery calcification is minimal.\\nABDOMEN: The study is not designed for assessment of\\nsubdiaphragmatic\\npathology; however, limited views were remarkable for moderate\\nascites with an attenuation value ranging between 19 to 35,\\nsuggesting complex fluid, unchanged since [**2198-4-22**].\\nBONES: There is no bone lesion concerning for malignancy or\\ninfection.\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. CT featuRes are concerning for progressive multifocal\\npulmonary hemorrhage, most pronounced in left lower lobe.\\n2. Left lower lobe bronchial tree occlusion is likely from\\naspirated blood.\\n3. Moderate ascites with attenuation ranging between 19 to 35 is\\nprobably\\ncomplex fluid, unchanged since [**2198-4-22**].\\n.\\n[**5-1**] CXR\\nFINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is\\nsubstantial\\nimprovement with substantially improved ventilation of the left\\nlung. Only at the left lung base, areas of atelectasis with\\nsubsequent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm persists.\\nTwo new tubular structures project over the left hemithorax.\\nThere is no\\nevidence of pneumothorax. The monitoring and support devices are\\noverall\\nconstant. Constant appearance of the right lung.\\n.\\n[**5-2**] LENIS\\nFINDINGS: There is normal phasicity within the common femoral\\nveins\\nbilaterally. The visualized vessels are patent and compressible\\nwith normal waveforms and augmentation. No thrombus identified.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT within the lower extremities\\nbilaterally.\\n.\\n[**5-2**] TTE\\nConclusions\\nThe left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left\\nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and\\nregional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular\\nchamber size is normal. with normal free wall contractility. The\\naortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good\\nleaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic\\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are elongated. There is\\nno mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet\\nof Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a\\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.\\nIMPRESSION: Poor image quality (patient difficult to position\\nand unable to cooperate). Preserved regional and global left\\nventricular systolic function. Based on limited views, right\\nventricular cavity size and function are probably normal.\\nPulmonary pressures were undetermined.\\nCompared with the prior study dated [**2198-4-17**] (images reviewed),\\nleft ventricular function is more vigorous. Other findings are\\nprobably similar although current suboptimal image quality\\nprecludes definite comparison.\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\n37F with SLE c/b lupus nephritis, w/ESRD on PD & bilateral PE on\\nchronic coumadin p/w hemoptysis & hypoxic respiratory failure,\\nfound to have L bronchial artery bleed.\\n\\n# HEMOPTYSIS\\nOn admission pt was HD stable, not hypoxia, and without airway\\ncompromise. She did have significant Hct drop, from 29.6 to 20.8\\nwithin 24h of admission. Pt is on chonic coumadin for hx\\nbilateral PE 11y ago; INR was elevated to 4.4 on admission.\\nExplanation for acute bleed not entirely clear - initial ddx\\nincluded infection (PNA vs abscess) in setting of elevated INR\\nmost likely; diffuse alveolar hemorrhage also possible, &\\nrheumatology consult also suggested possible pulmonary\\nvasculitis. No new PE seen on CTA. She initially received\\nantibiotics for possible pulmonary infection (vanc/levo/flagyl,\\nsubsequently narrowed to levo/flagyl). On HD3, underwent\\nCT-guided pulmonary angiography for question source of bleed and\\npossible bleeding into mediastinum. Bleed localized to L\\nbronchial artery, which was embolized. Solumedrol started for\\npossible vasculitis. Hct stabilized and uptrended thereafter.\\nThere was discussion of possible pulmonary wedge biopsy for\\npurpose of solidifying a tissue diagnosis to guide possible\\nimmunosuppression but this was decided against after\\nrisk/benefit analysis. Discharge Hct 35.9. Sent home w/steroid\\ntaper to be further managed in rheumatology follow-up next week.\\n\\n.\\n# HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE\\nPt developed respiratory failure while in the ICU, w/increasing\\nO2 requirement. CXR showed significant left-sided infiltrate,\\nmost likely from L bronchial arterial bleed (as discussed\\nabove). Pt developed progressive respiratory distress requiring\\nsupplemental O2. She was intubated on HD4 for rigid bronchoscopy\\nand was difficult to extubate, first because of persistent\\nL-sided infiltrate (blood) and volume overload (retained >5L\\nover 3-4d from PD), then because she developed ventilator\\nassociated pneumonia (VAP). She was already on levo/flagyl at\\nthe time (coverage for possible pulmonary infection as\\nprecipitant for hemoptysis, discussed above);\\naztreonam/vancomycin added briefly for VAP coverage. On repeat\\nbronchoscopy on HD9, large mucous plug removed from LUL\\nbronchus. Pt's respiratory status improved quickly thereafter,\\nand she was successfully extubated the following morning. Weaned\\nto RA within several hours, O2 sat in high 90s/RA for >48h\\nthereafter.\\n.\\n#CHRONIC PE/ANTICOAGULATION\\nHx indication for anticoagulation was revisited during this\\nadmission given hemoptysis and supratherapeutic INR on\\nadmission. No acute PE on CTA. [**Year (4 digits) **] was consulted and agreed\\nw/continuing to hold anticoagulation. IVC filter placed. Review\\nof OMR records revealed that anticoagulation was started in\\n[**6-/2187**] during hospitalization for lung abscess; large bilateral\\nPEs were revealed on CTA done for unexplained persistent sinus\\ntachycardia. She has been on anticoagulation since.

Your INR was >4 so we stopped coumadin. You\\nunderwent a procedure to localize and cauterize the source of\\nthe bleed: a left bronchial artery. You required intubation to\\nhelp you breathe as the blood in your left lung resolved. You\\nhad multiple bronchoscopies to remove blood clots and mucous\\nplugs. You were followed closely by rheumatologists who\\nrecommended steroids to dampen any possible lupus vasculitis,\\nwhich could have caused the bleed.\\n\\nYou also developed ventilator-associated pneumonia and were\\ntreated with antibiotics.\\n\\nYour PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] will continue to manage your coumadin. For now,\\ndo not take coumadin. We will recommend restarting coumadin in\\napproximately 1 week, after IVC filter removal, but the final\\ndecision will be made by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in cooperation with your\\nhematologist and rheumatologist.\\n\\nPlease see below for a list of warning signs. Please pay special\\nattention to any difficulty breathing, chest pain including\\ndiscomfort with breathing, leg or calf pain or swelling.

              "\"The urinalysis reveals a dark yellow, cloudy urine sample with several abnormalities. Chemical examination shows acidic pH (5.0), high specific gravity (1.030), and positive results for glucose, ketones, protein, bilirubin, nitrite, leukocyte esterase, and blood. Urobilinogen is elevated at 2.0 mg/dL. Microscopic examination indicates a high presence of RBCs (10-20 per HPF), WBCs (20-50 per HPF), moderate epithelial cells, hyaline casts (5-10 per LPF), moderate calcium oxalate crystals, many bacteria, and few yeast cells. The results suggest possible liver dysfunction and a significant urinary tract infection. Follow-up with a healthcare provider is recommended for further evaluation and management.\\n\\nBlood analysis shows elevated WBC count (12.5 x 10^9/L), indicating a possible infection. RBC count (4.2 x 10^12/L), hemoglobin (11.0 g/dL), and hematocrit (33%) are all below normal ranges, suggesting anemia. MCV (78 fL) and MCH (26 pg) are also below normal, indicating microcytic anemia. Platelet count is within normal range. Differential count shows elevated neutrophils (75%) and decreased lymphocytes (15%), which further supports the presence of an infection. Follow-up with a healthcare provider is recommended for further evaluation and management.\\n\\nElectrolyte levels are within normal ranges: Sodium (138 mmol/L), Potassium (4.5 mmol/L), Chloride (100 mmol/L), and Bicarbonate (24 mmol/L). However, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) is elevated at 25 mg/dL, and Creatinine is elevated at 1.8 mg/dL, indicating possible renal impairment. Glucose is also elevated at 140 mg/dL. Liver function tests show elevated levels of AST (60 U/L), ALT (55 U/L), and Total Bilirubin (2.1 mg/dL), further supporting the possibility of liver dysfunction. Follow-up with a healthcare provider is recommended for further evaluation and management.\\n\\nThe patient has a medical history of allergies to Bactrim, Vioxx, Penicillins, CellCept, Ceftriaxone, Ferrlecit, and Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics). The chief complaint upon admission was hemoptysis. Major surgical or invasive procedures performed include left bronchial artery embolization under fluoroscopy, right internal jugular line placement, repositioning, and removal, IVC filter placement, and intubation with mechanical ventilation. Follow-up with a healthcare provider is recommended for further evaluation and management.\\n\\nHistory of Present Illness:\\n37F with a history of lupus, lupus nephritis with ESRD on peritoneal dialysis on the transplant list, history of PE/Antiphospholipid antibody on coumadin, and mitral regurgitation, presents with a 4-6 month history of cough, worse in the morning, and one week of trace blood, now producing bright red blood over the last couple of days. The patient states that the amount of blood she has been coughing has been increasing and is now almost hourly, approximately 1 teaspoon of bright red blood. The patient states that the cough produced primarily yellow sputum until it turned to blood. The patient denies any other symptoms such as dizziness or lightheadedness. She denies any changes in her BMs, including consistency, frequency, and color. The patient visited her PCP recently, and a CXR was negative. Her INR was also noted to be subtherapeutic, and she took an extra day of 10 mg warfarin as instructed. Initial vitals in the ED were: HR 108, BP 138/95, RR 18, SpO2 100% on room air.\\n\\nHer INR was 4.4. A CTA was done for concern of PE which showed: 1. Left lower lobe consolidation with a large amount of secretions/fluid within the left lower lobe segmental bronchi. 2. Centrilobular nodules and ground glass opacities throughout both lungs, compatible with chronic collagen vascular disease, progressed since 2019. Ground glass opacities could also represent hemorrhage. 3. Chronic left lower segmental pulmonary arterial PE, unchanged since 2019. No new acute PE detected to the subsegmental levels. She was initially admitted to medicine but then transferred to the ICU.\\n\\nOn arrival to the MICU, initial vitals were: HR 110, BP 163/96, RR 20, SpO2 95% on room air.
